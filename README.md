# CIS 25 - Project 1
This is a program that's designed to provide an interface with the user in order to design a 5 by 5 tile with varying opacities.
# Setup
In order to run this program, simply execute main.cpp and the rest of the input should be done in the terminal.
The acceptable inputs are already listed in the program with the "list" and "help" functions, but for redudancy I will explain them in detail here.
